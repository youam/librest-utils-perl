        Removed the content_prefs() function as it isn't really helpful.

        Added some functions for parsing MIME types the right way.

        Made media_type() use the new MIME type parsing internally.

        Changed the return value of media_type() in cases where content
        negotiation is not supported for a request method.  e.g. DELETE.

        Improved some tests so they give better coverage.
